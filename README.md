# HW1
Contains Constant and Adjustable Linear Regulator

For the Linear Regulator I used the LM78L. Below is the datasheet for the regulator:

For the adjustable linear regulator, I used the LM317L-N. Below is the datasheet for this regulator:

After creating the blocks in Diptrace, the block needs to be exported as a DipTrace ASCII file. In order to Import the block back into a project in Diptrace, go to:
                            -> file
                            -> import
                            -> ASCII Diptrace file
                            
For the adjustment on the user's part I am not very confident on what this means as this is my first time doing any embedded system work and using diptrace. What I am thinking is the user may need to adjust some of the inputs and outputs that are in the blocks.
